     A
In a field

D          E         A
I am the absence of field

F#m                A
This is always the case

         Bm
Wherever I am

D              A
  I am what is missing


A                  E
When I walk I part the air

    F#m                  E
and always the air moves in

            Bm
to fill the spaces

D               A
where my body's been


D           A           Bm
We all have reasons for moving

A Bm   A  F#m  D      A
I move to keep things whole
