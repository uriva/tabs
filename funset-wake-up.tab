wena neya we na nehu

birds are flying inside of my mind

what is right or wrong i've got to decide

and even if my father showed me the way

if it's not from my soul it won't last a day

i can still feel your heart deeply inside

but even if it's right or wrong i've got to decide

what have i done here i must take a break

if it's not from my soul it won't last a day… why why

why these walls

why why (if it's not from my soul X 2)

why these walls (if it's not from my soul X 2)

why why (if it's not from my soul X 2)

why why (if it's not from my soul X 2)

why these walls (if it's not from my soul X 2)
